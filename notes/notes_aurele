Edge-Centric Computing : Vision and Challenges

Need for a new shift towards decentralization.
Social computing.
Lack of trust in centralized systems.
2 waves. edge : lots of individual machines.
         core : cloud

Problems with centralization:
	 loss of privacy
	 requires trust
	 unused personal devices (lots of computing power)

Proposition : keep data centers and cloud at the core.
But around it, smaller web servers : next layer.
Edge : individual human-controlled devices (computers, tablets, routers).

In edge computing:
proximity in the edge: (P2P, CDNs)
intelligence in the edge: autonomous decision making
trust in the edge: personal data stays in the edge
control in the edge: management of applications comes from the edge
humans in the edge: users have control on their information

Combine P2P and cloud. Cloud could provide stable data when necessary.
[10] confirms the performance of such hybrid systems.
peer ressources to build nano datacenters.

Fog Computing. Same but less focused on human-driven applications controlled from the edge.

including humans in data-analysis loops. Users acting as sensors. How to respect user privacy in this case.
The answer of edge-centric cloud computing is to not aggegate the datas.

Find correct tradeoff between mobile terminals and cloud servers.
Interconnects several clouds.
Difference for privacy : we can assume that the edge can be trusted.
Scalability must still be dealt with. However, the cloud provides more stable data.

You could decide which data is accessible to third party applications.
Trust in users may establish links between them...
Users won't have to deal with system administration.
Compromised servers may not induce leak of private data.
Geographical proximity may play a role.
Support for mobility.
