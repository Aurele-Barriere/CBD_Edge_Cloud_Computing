Introduction.

Limits of Cloud computing and the need for edge computation.

Define an hybrid system (fourth paper).

Performance, privacy, several time scales, coverage, programmability, locality.

Research interests:
	 parameters
	 architecture
	 workload distribution
	 problem identification and heuristics
	 programmability
	 naming...

Case example (traffic light?)

General issues:
	definitions,
	possible viewpoints,
	economic model

Conclusion



--------

Nothing yet on trust and privacy?

when does it work?
 - when we need centralized analysis and low latency
 - when communication from the edge to the core is the bottleneck but data could be consumed at the edge
 - when there's mobility and locality involved. location awareness can be used to minimize communications
 - when some data cannot be shared publicly (lack of trust)
 - when some data needs to be stored locally
 - when we want a better coverage for low-latency services
 - when we need to analyze data at different time scales
