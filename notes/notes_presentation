Introduction.

Limits of Cloud computing and the need for edge computation.

Define an hybrid system (fourth paper).

Performance, privacy, several time scales, coverage, programmability, locality.

Research interests:
	 parameters
	 architecture
	 workload distribution
	 problem identification and heuristics
	 programmability
	 naming...

Case example (traffic light?)

General issues:
	definitions,
	possible viewpoints,
	economic model
